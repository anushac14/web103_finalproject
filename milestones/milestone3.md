## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

Getting feedback for our presentation went really well and also learning about git workflows was helpful.

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

We had some challenges with coordinating to complete the presentation for the pitch

### Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?

No, we did not finish all the tasks in our sprint plan due to the teams busy schedule. We plan to split up tasks and work on the main crud features of the app first like adding/deleting songs to a playlist and maybe redirecting songs to spotify 

### Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

Some at risk features would definitely be implenting the recommendation system and collaborations features because we will not have much time. If this is the case, we will prioritze the tasks that are able to be completed first then maybe create basic UI to show how the "at risk" features will look like.

### 5. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

Going to office hours to ensure we are on the right track for the project
