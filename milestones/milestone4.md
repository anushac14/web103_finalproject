## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

What went well for us was learning about how to implement authorization

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

We did not have any challenges in particular for this unit, except for working through the lab

### Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?

We had a lot more planned for this week but due to our busy schedules we were not able to finish everything we planned. We are priortizing our music finder/home page because that includes all the basic requirements of our app to get full credit

### Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

I think our at risk features are anything to do with collaboration with other users.

### 5. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

Going to office hours possibly and asking questions on the slack channel
